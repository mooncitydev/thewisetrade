  <h1>Solana DAO tools</h1>
  <p>
    To build a strong community for your NFT collection, the Solana eco-system
    proposes a wide-range of tools. This guide aims at listing the must-have
    software required to delight and serve your holders.
  </p>
  <h2 id="discord-access-and-role-management-matrica">
    Discord access and role management: Matrica
  </h2>
  <p>
    Like any DAO, you probably want to give restricted access to holders
    verifying certain conditions. For that you need to give specific roles only
    to holders of your NFT. Another good idea is to reward multiple holders with
    specific badges. Matrica can handle both for you. In some way it’s the
    gatekeeper of your Discord.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally it comes with a sales bot allowing to have a feed of every
    sales in your Discord.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: 5 sol a month or burning two of their NFTs for a lifetime usage.</p>

  <h2 id="whitelist-and-giveaway-management-subber">
    Whitelist and giveaway management: Subber
  </h2>
  <p>
    To enlighten your community, it’s common to offer whitelist spots or
    presales of upcoming collections. Managing, the winning conditions, the
    winners and the participants can be tedious. Subber proposes to handle all
    the heavy stuff for you and integrates seamlessly with your Discord server.
    It comes too with social features between all the community using Subber.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: free</p>

  <h2 id="pre-sales-and-merchandising-payment-helio">
    Pre-sales and merchandising payment: Helio
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you want to run a pre-sale session or needs to sell anything to your
    community while keeping the web3 vibe, you will have to handle payment
    through Solana wallets. Online payment can be very tricky. Fortunately, the
    Helio platform can manage everything for you. It will allow you to set up
    online form where your users can pay with any token and then have access to
    their goods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cost: 2% fees + holding a NFT from their collection (or paying 50$/month)

  <h2 id="governance-management-hadeswap">Governance management: Hadeswap</h2>
  <p>
    To run the important votes for the proposals of your DAO on chain it’s
    better to use a proven solution. Hadeswap, aside its AMM, proposes the
    necessary tooling to submit a proposal and run votes for. It allows to show
    the community possessions too.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: free</p>

  <h2 id="community-engagement-utility-ape">
    Community engagement: Utility Ape
  </h2>
  <p>
    To motivate your community to advertise your collection, you can reward them
    with your collection tokens when they retweet, like or comment your
    publications. The same way, you may want them to comment popular tweets
    meaningful for your collection. It’s not something easy to manage unless you
    use a tool like Utility Ape. They provide you with efficient Dashboards to
    deal with community engagement and connect directly with Discord to allow
    rewarding their Twitter actions through Discord..
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatives are popping up like AlphaPharaos or Mindfolk Connect but
    currently Utility Ape seems to be the market leader.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: Between 60$/month and 300$/month depending on the Discord size.</p>

  <h2 id="crypto-and-nft-news-syndicate-network">
    Crypto and NFT news: Syndicate Network
  </h2>
  <p>
    Another way to enlighten your community is to provide qualitative news every
    day right into your Discord. Syndicate Network does research everyday to
    provide your holders with the latest actuality.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: free (sponsored content upcoming)</p>

  <h2 id="funds-management-squads">Funds management: Squads</h2>
  <p>
    Another big question is: how to manage the funds collected by your DAO? One
    thing to build more trust is to have a wallet managed by several persons: a
    multi-sig wallet that requires the approval of several persons to confirm a
    transaction. Squads manages this for you and provides many services to
    diversify your fund investments: tokens buying, NFTs, validator staking, and
    more. No more headache for the fund governance!
  </p>
  <p>Cost: unknown</p>

  <h2 id="-automatic-activity-mee6-">
    <strong>Automatic activity: MEE6</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Last but not least, a tool massively used by any Discord community, the MEE6
    bot. It allows you to setup automatic actions like welcoming new users or
    creating reaction roles. It tracks for you the members activity and give
    them levels related to their activity.
  </p>
  <p>Cost: 40$ month</p>

    That’s it, I hope you enjoyed and discovered new tools. Please let me know
    if you have any suggestions!
