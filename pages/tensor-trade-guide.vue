  <h1>Tensor Quickstart Guide</h1>
  <p>
    After trading for a while your NFTs on Magic Eden, you will notice that
    there are a lot of fancy stuff that comes into your way. You will feel a
    little bit limited and think that things could be more straightforward. You
    are trading on a regular basis and understand that you need more advanced
    tooling. But what to chose next? Good news, a platform recently emerged
    solving this problem:
    <a
      href="https://tensor.trade"
      >Tensor Trade</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    This platform initially is designed for pro-traders. But, for a casual
    trader, it is a very powerful tool too. That’s why I wrote this guide that
    will help you to take the most out of Tensor in a few minutes. It covers the
    main features you can use to improve your NFT trading on Solana.
  </p>
  <h1 id="1-list-hot-and-favorite-collections">
    1. List hot and favorite collections
  </h1>
  <h3 id="collections-list">Collections List</h3>
  <p>
    The biggest strength of Tensor is its hot collection list. It’s super fast
    to load and it shows you all the main information about a collection: floor
    price, 24h volume, 24h floor price change, number of elements listed. In a
    glimpse, you have information needed to make your buying or selling
    decisions. It’s the first thing you see when you connect to the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bonus: Everything is updated in real-time, you don’t need to refresh your
    browser. Your tabs can stay open.
  </p>
  <p>

    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="filters">
    <em><strong>Filters</strong></em>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Most of the time, you don’t need to see the collections you can’t afford.
    For instance it’s not that interesting to see Degods on the top of the list.
    If you can spend 50 sols at maximum, you don’t care about their current
    floor price. For this reason, the Collections list can be filtered very
    easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    With filters you will be able to remove everything above your maximum
    investment capability. In the same vein, you will be able to filter
    collections with low volume. It will remove many false positive. In the end,
    with a few clicks, you will see the hot collection of the day or week in
    your investment range.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img

      alt="Screenshot 2"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    There are too much data flowing in the NFT market while you need focus to
    make good investments. Tensor removes the fancy stuff in both ways: through
    its clean UI and with the filters that cleans noise from the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-03.png"
      alt="Screenshot 3"
    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="favorites">
    <em><strong>Favorites</strong></em>
  </h3>
  <p>
    It’s common to follow only a given set of collections. You did your
    researches about them and want to track only the evolution of the collection
    with the biggest potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make things easier, Tensor allows you to mark collections as favorites.
    You can mark a favorite in the collection or directly in the search results
    via a research in the search bar (which is very handy)
  </p>
  <p>
    Then you can ask to only shows your favorite collections and watch their
    main information. Similar to the filter, it allows you to set up lists of
    interest quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-04.png"
      alt="Screenshot 4"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    You can manage three lists of favorites, via the bottom bar if you need to
    classify your favorites:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-05.png"
      alt="Screenshot 5"
    />
  </p>
  <h1 id="2-manage-your-inventory">2. Manage your inventory</h1>
  <h3 id="display-inventory">
    <em><strong>Display inventory</strong></em>
  </h3>
  <p>There are two ways to display your inventory:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clicking on the top right “Inventory” button. It Displays a panel giving
      you a quick access to it with a recap of all floor prices and buttons for
      quick access to the related collection. You can click on any NFT to list
      it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-06.png"
      alt="Screenshot 6"
    />
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Or by using the Portfolio button in the top left menu. From there you will
      be able to display your inventory in a full page. Everything is summarized
      on the left. On the right you have access to all your NFTs. By clicking on
      them you will be able to list them via a dedicated modal window.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-07.png"
      alt="Screenshot 7"
    />
  </p>
  <p>The listing modal:</p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-08.png"
      alt="Screenshot 8"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    You can list your NFT with a similar mechanism but remember that the moto of
    Tensor is efficiency, so no confirmation will be asked. Be sure before
    setting a list price.
  </p>
  <h1 id="3-trade-your-nfts">3. Trade your NFTs</h1>
  <h3 id="buy-and-list-nft">
    <em><strong>Buy and list NFT</strong></em>
  </h3>
  <p>
    I won’t cover here the buying and listing of NFTs because it’s very
    straighforward. When you put your mouse over a NFT, it proposes you to buy
    it if you are browsing a collection, or selling it if you are holding it.
    Tensor allows you too to swap your floor NFT with another one from their
    liquidity pools when swapping is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-09.png"
      alt="Screenshot 9"
    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="collect-information-on-collection-recent-activity-rarities-and-more">
    <em
      >Collect information on collection: recent activity, rarities and more</em
    >
  </h3>
  <p>
    Another strong point of Tensor is the data displayed when browsing an NFT
    collection. On the same screen you can have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The price evolution</li>
    <li>The main collection statistics (listing, volume, …)</li>
    <li>
      NFTs price and rarity levels in a form of pictures or list (it requires to
      switch between light and pro mode via the bottom bar)
    </li>
    <li>The recent activity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-10.png"
      alt="Screenshot 10"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-11.png"
      alt="Screenshot 11"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    Another strong point is the fact is that there is tab showing book order
    walls to guess the upcoming resistance:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-12.png"
      alt="Screenshot 12"
    />
  </p>
  <p>And a tab to track rare traits floor price:</p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-13.png"
      alt="Screenshot 13"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    With all this data at hand, you have everything you need for your buying
    decision whether you want to buy at floor price or looking for rare pieces
    from the collection. Tensor truly empowers you for a maximum efficiency.
  </p>
  <h3 id="floor-sweeping"><em>Floor sweeping</em></h3>
  <p>
    A floor sweeping tool (and the equivalent for buying) is available right in
    the application which is pretty convenient to invest heavily in a
    collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-14.png"
      alt="Screenshot 14"
    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="bid-a-collection"><em>Bid a collection</em></h3>
  <p>
    Another very useful feature is the capability to bid a collection like in
    Magic Eden. It allows you to provide quick exit liquidity for holders who
    need to sell their NFT quickly. You set a price and anyone can sell his NFT
    to you instantly. That way, you can accumulate NFTs from this collection at
    a price below the Floor price. You can set multiple bids if you want to
    gradually buy a collection of which the price is going down.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-15.png"
      alt="Screenshot 15"
    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="amm-and-swing-trading"><em>AMM and Swing Trading</em></h3>
  <p>
    One of the main product of Tensor trade is the Auto Market Making feature.
    It’s more aimed at big holders or collection managers but it can be useful
    to you too. The idea is to provide liquidity to a collection. You provide
    both sols and NFTs and set buy and sell prices. Your sols are use as buying
    bids on the collection while all your NFTs are listed at your sell price. So
    when the price moves around your buying and sell price, tensor will
    automatically buy and sell the collection NFTs. It will allow the other
    users to do quick buys or sells and you will accumulate sols from the margin
    done at each sale. The only issue is when the price leaves the price range.
    You have to either wait until the price range is reached again or modifiy it
    to adapt to the new accumulation zone.
  </p>
  <p>Here is a very simple example of AMM settings for a single NFT:</p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="~/assets/images/screenshots/tensor-16.png"
      alt="Screenshot 16"
    />
  </p>
  <h3 id="notifications"><em>Notifications</em></h3>
  <p>
  You can set email or mobile notifications to always be aware when something
  happes with your wallet: bid accepted, NFT sold, on AMM doing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s it for this Tensor quickstart guide! I hope it was useful to you. If
    you don’t know this tool, I really encourage you to give it a try. I show
    you that it gives you a very fast UI to do your trading and provide you with
    all the data you need to take your decision. It definitely has its place in
    your daily NFT trading routine.
